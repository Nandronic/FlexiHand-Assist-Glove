## 💡 Problem Statement  
People with physical disabilities often struggle with everyday activities such as eating, dressing, or walking — tasks that require assistance from others.  
The **FlexiHand Assist Glove** is designed to empower such individuals by assisting them in performing these daily tasks independently.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To design and develop a **smart assistive glove** that helps people with disabilities in performing daily activities by mimicking hand gestures and enhancing mobility.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Components Used  
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino UNO  
- **Sensors:** Flex Sensors  
- **Actuators:** Servo Motors  
- **Connectivity:** Jumper Wires  
- **Power Source:** Battery Module  
- **Supporting Tools:** Embedded C, Arduino IDE  

---

## 🧩 Working Principle  
The glove detects **finger bending and motion** using flex sensors.  
The sensor readings are processed by the Arduino controller, which drives servo motors to **replicate or assist hand movements** — helping the user perform specific tasks.
