## 💡 Problem Statement  
A disabled person struggles in daily life — eating, dressing, walking — and depends on others.  
The main goal of **FlexiHand Assist Glove** is to help such people perform their daily activities independently using smart motion sensors and servo assistance.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To develop a **wearable assistive glove** that detects finger movement using flex sensors and replicates the motion with servo motors, allowing smoother and autonomous control for disabled users.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Components Used  
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino UNO  
- **Sensors:** Flex Sensors  
- **Actuators:** Servo Motors  
- **Connectivity:** Jumper Wires  
- **Power Source:** Battery Module  
- **Programming Tools:** Embedded C, Arduino IDE

## 🧩 Block Diagram  
*(Refer to project PDF for full schematic diagram)*

---

## 🧠 Outcome  
The **FlexiHand Assist Glove** uses motion sensors to detect finger movements.  
When the fingers flex beyond a threshold, the glove triggers servo motors to respond.  
Arduino integration allows the prosthetic to communicate with nearby guardians or devices — improving safety and awareness.  

This combination of **sensor feedback + servo control + Arduino connectivity** enhances the usability of prosthetic limbs, offering natural motion and independence.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- Integration of **GSM module** for alerts and telemedicine support.  
- **Remote monitoring** and data transmission for caregivers.  
- **Voice/gesture control** upgrades.  
- **Lightweight, ergonomic glove design** for daily comfort.
